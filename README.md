🌍 Global Air Quality Analysis
📌 Overview
This project investigates global air pollution trends using a dataset that includes AQI (Air Quality Index) and pollutant measurements (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) across various cities and countries. The objective is to analyze pollution patterns, identify the most affected regions, and extract actionable insights from the data.

📂 Dataset
1. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedmtalhahasan/global-urban-air-quality-index-dataset-2015-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com&select=global_air_quality_dataset.csv
2. File: global_air_quality_dataset.csv
3. Attributes:
    ->Country, City, Date
    ->AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3
    ->Meteorological data like Wind Speed

🎯 Objectives
1. Understand air pollution distribution by country and city.
2. Identify the most polluted cities.
3. Analyze pollutant concentrations and seasonal trends.
4. Examine the relationship between wind speed and pollution.
5. Visualize pollution data using graphs and heatmaps.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Cleaned and preprocessed missing/invalid values.
2.  Visualized AQI by country and top 5 cities.
3. Compared pollutant levels across countries.
4. Analyzed monthly trends for AQI and pollutants.
5. Explored the effect of wind speed on PM2.5.
6. Identified cities with the highest pollution levels.

📊 Key Insights
1. Countries like India show significantly higher AQI values.
2. PM2.5 and PM10 are the most severe pollutants in urban regions.
3. Pollution spikes seasonally, especially in Delhi in Feburary .
4. Higher wind speed helps reduce PM2.5 in several cities.

📎 Tools & Libraries Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib  
4. Numpy

✅ Conclusions
1. Air quality is poor in several developing countries and major cities.
2. Seasonal and meteorological factors influence pollution levels.
3. Data-driven policies can be guided using this analysis.

🔮 Future Work
1. Build machine learning models to predict AQI or pollutants.
2. Add time-series forecasting for future air quality trends.
3. Use interactive maps for geo-visualization of AQI.
